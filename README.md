- ðŸ”­ I just completed BCIT's FWD (Front-End Web Developer) Program. I've completed four 300-hour certifications at Free Code Camp, and gleaned front-end dev skills from MOOCs, bootcamps and hackathons prior to that. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UX & Web Design, D3.js, React, Node.js, JavaScript, SASS/SCSS, PHP, and UI prototyping tools (Adobe XD, Figma, Invision, Balsamiq). 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: non-profit work, explanatory works, technical documentation, and interactive storytelling.
